# Overview

I created a database that holds the inventory to the video games I own. 

I wanted to create this database to see how big my inventory was without having to go through old cases and search high and low for all of my games.

# Relational Database

I created this database using MySQL

This database only contains one table, which is the video_game_inventory

# Development Environment

This was done using two programs: MySQL using MySQL Workbench as well as MySQL Python. 
Programming Language: MySQL, Python

# Future Work

* This could be expanded. With more game purchases, the inventory will expand.
* I could link multiple tables together, if wanting to break down series of games or single vs. multiplayer games.
* I would like to add a better way to display the inventory better, something in the format of a spreadsheet or similar.
